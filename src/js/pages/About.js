            <h1>Into the dub</h1>
            <p>
                A dub celebration. Groovy funky rhythms. Deep meditative basslines. Trippy dub effects. The vibe of
                a grooving live band combined with a way of playing that imitates the studio works of the dub masters
                of different eras. That’s what you get when you go to a Dub Healers concert. A purely positive
                message delivered with love.
            </p>
            <h1>Freestyle live dubbing</h1>
            <p>
                The Dub Healers way of playing can be described as freestyle live dubbing. While using original
                compositions and arrangement as a starting point, a Dub Healers show is, in its core, a collective
                improvisation. But a special kind of improvisation in which each band member will stick to their
                individual rhythm section part. Instead of improvising what to play, the creative focus is on letting
                different parts come in and out of the music and playing with echo and reverb effect. Thus imitating the
                way a dub producer uses the mixing desk as an instrument to create a dub mix.
            </p>
            <p>
                This way of playing creates the same kind of special atmosphere and is well known from the dub genre,
                pushing and grooving as well as meditative. Combine this with the vibration from a well-played live band
                and you have the Dub Healers.
